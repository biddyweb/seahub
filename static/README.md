# Build Semantic UI

A prebuilt Semantic css/js files are placed in directory dist. You can use
semantic.min.js and semantic.min.css directly without installing the tools
needed to compile Semantic UI.

In case you need to modify Semantic UI, you can build it by:

1. Install npm
2. Install gulp: `npm install -g gulp`
3. Install install semantic dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build Semantic: `gulp build`
